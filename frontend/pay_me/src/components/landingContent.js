        <h1>Pay me.</h1>
        <p>A service to remind those forgetful friends, colleagues and clients to pay you back.</p>
        <br></br>
        <h4>How it works</h4>
        <p>Simply add the details of your debtors and create invoices for them. You will be able to keep track of who owes you, 
            and we will be sending out friendly daily reminders (automatic calls and texts) for them to pay you back.
        </p>
